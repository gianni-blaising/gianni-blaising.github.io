<!-- ILLUSTRATION EN-TÊTE : Sorbonne / Mathématiques -->


I am Gianni Blaising, a third-year undergraduate student in Mathematics at Sorbonne University.

This website serves as a research log documenting my academic journey and my preparation for the BMST 2026 program (Bachelor in Mathematics Student Team) within the 4EU+ Alliance.

Project Roadmap: The Brunn-Minkowski Inequality

My Goal: To investigate the Brunn-Minkowski inequality not just as a geometric theorem, but as a crossroads between analysis, geometry, and probability.

I have structured my work into four distinct phases, moving from fundamental tools to advanced applications.

Phase 1: Foundations & "Crash Course"

Visual intuition of the Minkowski Sum (A+B).

To ensure rigor and refine my scientific writing skills, I initiated this project by consolidating the essential mathematical tools required for high-dimensional geometry. This preliminary phase covers:

Measure Theory
Revisiting the construction of the Lebesgue measure and the critical role of Fubini's theorem in slicing arguments.

Theory of Convex Bodies
Formalizing definitions of convexity, compact sets, and support functions in $\mathbb{R}^n$.

The Minkowski Sum
Building geometric intuition on how set addition behaves (regularity, smoothing properties) compared to standard union operations.

Phase 2: The Functional Approach (Core Research)

The connection to probability: Log-concavity illustrated by the Gaussian distribution.

Moving beyond classical geometric decompositions, I focus on the modern analytical proof of the inequality.

Key Tool: The Prékopa-Leindler inequality.

Methodology: Studying the proof by induction on dimension $n$, based on the advanced lecture notes of Prof. Dario Cordero-Erausquin. This approach highlights the deep connection between the inequality and the log-concavity of measures.

Phase 3: High-Dimensional Phenomena

Visualizing 4D+: Projection of a Tesseract (Hypercube).

I extend the theoretical analysis with computational experiments to visualize counter-intuitive behaviors in high dimensions.

Simulations: I replicate the "Ball vs. Hypercube" volume collapse example from the UE 4M073 course (Non-Parametric Statistics) taught by Prof. Etienne Roquain.

Concentration of Measure: Illustrating how mass concentrates near the boundary of convex sets as $d \to \infty$.

Phase 4: Perspectives & Isoperimetry

Geometric implications: Minimizing perimeter for a fixed volume.

Finally, I connect these geometric insights to broader mathematical results.

The Isoperimetric Inequality
I will demonstrate how Brunn-Minkowski implies the isoperimetric inequality (the Euclidean ball minimizes surface area for a fixed volume).

Applications
Bridging the gap between pure mathematics and Data Science by exploring the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma, a direct consequence of measure concentration.
