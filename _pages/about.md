Welcome

I am Gianni Blaising, a third-year undergraduate student in Mathematics at Sorbonne University.

This website serves as a research log documenting my academic journey and my preparation for the BMST 2026 program (Bachelor in Mathematics Student Team) within the 4EU+ Alliance.

Project Roadmap: The Brunn-Minkowski Inequality

My goal is to investigate the Brunn-Minkowski inequality not just as a geometric theorem, but as a crossroads between analysis, geometry, and probability. To achieve this, I have structured my work into four distinct phases, moving from fundamental tools to advanced applications.

Phase 1: Foundations & "Crash Course"

To ensure rigor and refine my scientific writing skills, I initiated this project by consolidating the essential mathematical tools required for high-dimensional geometry. This preliminary phase covers:

Measure Theory: Revisiting the construction of the Lebesgue measure and the critical role of Fubini's theorem in slicing arguments.

Theory of Convex Bodies: Formalizing definitions of convexity, compact sets, and support functions in $\mathbb{R}^n$.

The Minkowski Sum: Building geometric intuition on how set addition behaves (regularity, smoothing properties) compared to standard union operations.

Phase 2: The Functional Approach (Core Research)

Moving beyond classical geometric decompositions, I focus on the modern analytical proof of the inequality.

Key Tool: The Prékopa-Leindler inequality.

Methodology: Studying the proof by induction on dimension $n$, based on the advanced lecture notes of Prof. Dario Cordero-Erausquin. This approach highlights the deep connection between the inequality and the log-concavity of measures.

Phase 3: High-Dimensional Phenomena

I extend the theoretical analysis with computational experiments to visualize counter-intuitive behaviors in high dimensions.

Simulations: I replicate the "Ball vs. Hypercube" volume collapse example from the UE 4M073 course (Non-Parametric Statistics) taught by Prof. Etienne Roquain.

Concentration of Measure: Illustrating how mass concentrates near the boundary of convex sets as $d \to \infty$.

Phase 4: Perspectives & Isoperimetry

Finally, I connect these geometric insights to broader mathematical results.

The Isoperimetric Inequality: I will demonstrate how Brunn-Minkowski implies the isoperimetric inequality (the Euclidean ball minimizes surface area for a fixed volume).

Applications: Bridging the gap between pure mathematics and Data Science by exploring the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma, a direct consequence of measure concentration.
