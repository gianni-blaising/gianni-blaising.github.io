    > *This paper is widely considered the definitive survey on the subject, linking the inequality to the theory of mixed volumes and isoperimetry.*

My study relies heavily on advanced course materials provided by the faculty at Sorbonne University.

### Functional Analysis & Log-Concavity
* **Prof. Dario Cordero-Erausquin** – *Department of Mathematics, Sorbonne University*
    * **Context:** Detailed proofs of the Prékopa-Leindler inequality and the functional approach to geometry. These notes are crucial for Phase 2 of my roadmap.

### High-Dimensional Probability & Statistics
* **Prof. Etienne Roquain** – *Department of Mathematics, Sorbonne University*
    * **Context:** *Statistique Non-Paramétrique (UE 4M073)*.
    * **Relevance:** These notes provide the intuition for the "curse of dimensionality" and phenomena such as the concentration of measure on the boundary of convex sets (specifically the "Ball vs. Hypercube" volume collapse studied in Phase 3).
