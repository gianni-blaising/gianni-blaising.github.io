Here is a curated list of the primary resources, lecture notes, and foundational papers guiding this research project.

### 🏛️ Sorbonne University Course Materials
*My study relies heavily on the rigorous theoretical framework provided by the faculty at Sorbonne University.*

* **Prof. Dario Cordero-Erausquin** – *Department of Mathematics, Sorbonne University*
  * **Context:** *Functional Analysis & Log-Concavity*.
  * **Relevance:** Detailed proofs of the Prékopa-Leindler inequality and the functional approach to geometry. These notes are the theoretical engine behind **Phase 2** of my roadmap.

* **Prof. Etienne Roquain** – *Department of Mathematics, Sorbonne University*
  * **Context:** *Statistique Non-Paramétrique (UE 4M073)*.
  * **Relevance:** These notes provided the intuition for the "curse of dimensionality" and phenomena such as the concentration of measure (specifically the "Ball vs. Hypercube" volume collapse simulated in **Phase 3**).

### 📖 Key Textbooks & Monographs

* **Prof. Jean-François Le Gall**
  * **Context:** *Intégration, Probabilités et Processus Aléatoires*.
  * **Relevance:** The foundational text for **Phase 1**. It was essential for revisiting the rigorous construction of the Lebesgue measure and mastering Fubini’s theorem for slicing arguments.
  * [🔗 Course Notes (PDF)](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~jflegall/IPPA2.pdf)

* **Schneider, R. (2014).** *Convex Bodies: The Brunn-Minkowski Theory*. Cambridge University Press.
  > The definitive reference work for classical convex geometry.

* **Vershynin, R. (2018).** *High-Dimensional Probability: An Introduction with Applications in Data Science*. Cambridge University Press.
  > **Focus:** Chapters 3 and 5.
  > Essential for understanding convexity in high dimensions, the geometry of random vectors, and why orthogonality behaves counter-intuitively as $d \to \infty$.

* **Wainwright, M. J. (2019).** *High-Dimensional Statistics: A Non-Asymptotic Viewpoint*. Cambridge University Press.
  > **Focus:** Chapter 7.
  > Provides the statistical framework for convex relaxation ($L_1$ norms) and sparse recovery.

### 📄 Foundational Papers & Surveys

* **Gardner, R. J. (2002).** "The Brunn-Minkowski inequality". *Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society*, 39(3), 355-405.
  > This paper is widely considered the definitive survey on the subject, linking the inequality to the theory of mixed volumes and isoperimetry.
  * [📄 Read the Article (AMS.org)](https://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2002-39-03/S0273-0979-02-00941-2/)

* **Ball, K. (1997).** "An Elementary Introduction to Modern Convex Geometry". *Flavors of Geometry*, MSRI Publications.
  > A key resource for understanding the "modern" approach to the subject, moving away from classical shapes to analytic inequalities.

* **Chandrasekaran, V., Recht, B., Parrilo, P. A., & Willsky, A. S. (2012).** "The Convex Geometry of Linear Inverse Problems". *Foundations of Computational Mathematics*.
  > Explores the geometry of the tangent cone and Gaussian width in the context of inverse problems.

* **Rigollet, P. (2017).** *High Dimensional Statistics*. MIT OpenCourseWare.
  > Lecture notes providing a complementary perspective on concentration inequalities and statistical learning.
